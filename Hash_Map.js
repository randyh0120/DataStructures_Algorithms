// Hash Map
// Hash Map and Hash Table are the same thing

/*
// Hash Map are used to store key-value pairs
// Keys in a Hash Table are not ordered
// Unlike Arrays, they are very fast for inserting and removing
*/

/*
// Python has Dictionaries
// JS has Objects and Maps*
// * Objects have som erestrictions, but are basically has tables
// Java, Go, Scala haves Maps
// Ruby has Hashes
*/

// We implement our own Hash Map here.

// Heaps

// What is a Binary Heap?
// A Heap is similar to a BST, but has different rules
// Like a BST a Binary Heap can only have 2 children per node.

/*
// Max Binary Heap:
// Parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.
// Each Parent has at most 2 children.
// There is no order between siblings.
// A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be. The left children are filled out first.
// They are not sorted like a BST.
// All that matters is that the Parent Node is larger than the child.

/*
// Use Cases
// A Priority Queue is implemented using a Binary Heap
// Graph Traversals

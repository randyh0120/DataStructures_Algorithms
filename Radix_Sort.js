// RADIX SORT
// Radix Sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers
// It never makes comparisons between elements
// It exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits
// More digits means a bigger number

// The amount of buckets depends on the base of the numbers.
// Base 10 has 10 buckets, base 7 has 7 buckets.

// You split up the numbers based on how many digits the largest number has
// For example: 4579 is the largest number is an array, then it will take 4 iterations to sort the entire array.
